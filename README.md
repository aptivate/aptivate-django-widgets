aptivate-django-widgets
=======================

Low-bandwidth friendly widgets for Django


Installation
------------
If you installed this app as a Python package using pip, then dependancies
should already be taken cared of. Otherwise install packages listed in
requirements.txt.


Usage
-----
Most widgets depend on Javascript parts that have to be add to the page
*after* the widgets. Javascript parts are dependant on jQuery or jQuery-like
library. You can use provided mjp.js in case you are not using jQuery yet,
otherwise go with the latter (but always use only one of them on the page).

TBD: Better documentation. For now look at source (there is not that much
     of it)
